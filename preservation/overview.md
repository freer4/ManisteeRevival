An overview to the preservation of Manistee's landmarks and history

Manistee is home to a museum. This has long been a great way to share the unique history of the city with visitors and residents alike. No major changes should be planned in the short term for this institution. 

Manistee also has a train museum that is a fun stop for many. See "transportation" section for further use ideas. 

Manistee has a great number of historically protected buildings that exemplify victorian archetecture. In order to properly preserve these buildings in the long term their very existance must be cause for an influx of capital to keep them in a good state of repair. 

1. Tours of some historic buildings of the city are a simple and direct way for these buildings to bring in money.
2. A tour of the city itself to show off buildings and homes (perhaps open-topped busses in good weather) is another simple and direct income centered on these historic structures.
3. Downtown Manistee, particularly River Street from Manistee Lake to 1st Street Beach, should be the focal point of those coming to the city. This should be the main attraction, not just a point of interest. The historic buildings should all be actively functional as businesses, particularly to cater to tourists. Other, more modern and cost-efficient facilities should be focused on providing for the day-to-day needs of residents. This separation will be important - while Downtown should be a fantastic place for everyone to come, its primary purpose should be to bring in tourism money. Most of the rest of Manistee should be there primarily for the citizens of the city. See "destinations" for more information.
