The purpose of traffic updates in relation to the Revival is to keep tourist traffic to a minimum while keeping all local attractions easily accesible.

**Travel to and from**

*make getting to and from Manistee cost-effective, attractive, and stress free for tourists*

The more tourists that come to Manistee without their personal vehicles, the less traffic congesting the streets. To ensure that alternative travel is the norm for visitors we will need a solid plan to get people into the City, and then local transportation to take them to points of interest.

*By land*

Greyhounds or other travel busses from major cities in Michigan and surrounding states should at least provide a stop in/near Downtown Manistee, if not a direct route. 

Amtrak runs through Chicago and Cleveland. There should be a route established to bring passengers to town, preferably near the current Train Museum if possible. Train travel is a fun and someone token way to travel for those vacationing.

*By sea*

Passengers can be bussed from Ludington to Downton Manistee initially to utilize existing ferry services. Eventually, Manistee should be the destination for boat travel. 

Chicago and Millwaukee should have direct runs to Manistee. 

*By air*

Increased commercial flight schedules should be negotiated. Subsidized if necessary. Think Vegas - cheap to get to, spend your money once you are here. 

**Travel upon arival**

*upon arriving, travel to all points of interest should be painless possible without a car*

*Trolley*

Build more trollies in the style of the on Dial-a-ride currently runs. Use these for local Manistee travel, particularly up and down River Street from Manistee Lake through Water Street/1st Street to 1st Street beach, with ample stops along that route. 

*Busses*

Bus tourists to and from nearby points of interest. 

**Motorist traffic**

*keep tourist motor traffic to a minimum*

River Street from Cypress (US 31) to Water Street will be closed to all motorist traffic except trollies.

North of Water on Poplar and Filer on Greenbush will be closed to all except deliveries. 

Eemergency vehicles are exception to these two rules.

**Parking**
Downtown parking will be entirely concentrated just south of Downtown, directly behind the buildings on the south side of River Street. This will allow easy access for our residents and lont-term parking for visitors who will utilize our local services upon arival.
