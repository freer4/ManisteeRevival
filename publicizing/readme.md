**Pricing**

Travel packages should be available for a myriad of the nearest large cities. There should be budget transportation and stay options that do not detract from the experience. They need to be geared towards getting to Manistee - these should not be major profit centers. We want tourists to spend their money during the experience, not trying to get to us. 

Packages should range up in price from there. On the far end of the spectrum should be first-class flights or luxury boat travel, private transportation around the Manistee area, and swanky hotel suites in beautiful Victorian motif.
