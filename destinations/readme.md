*A map of destinations for those visting Manistee*

Historic Downtown Manistee

Rather than a point of interest, this should be branded as the main draw for tourists. Toursits should arive directly here, often to stay here on their visit. 

Treat River Street from Maple Street to Division Street as an outdoor mall. 

River street, from Maple to Division at the least, will be repaved length with brick and heated to keep the street clear and dry year-round without the destructive effect of snowplows. 

Increase trolley presense. Run non-stop throughout the day back and forth down River Street from Manistee Lake to 1st Street Beach.  

Buildings on this stretch that are not historically protected and do not fit with the victorian image of the City will be gradually replaced with new buildings that do fit. 

From Maple to Division street will have their sidewalks glassed in on each side for each block.
