The purpose of Historic Downtown Manistee in the Revival will be to create a major, central draw based around the authentic Victorian archetecture, rather than a mere point of interest. You can go to a casino or fishing or skiing or the beach or any of the other attractions all over the place. It's the culmination of all of these draws centered around this unique and well-preserved Victorian city that can help Manistee stand apart.

We also want to keep the "fudgies" from directly interfering with the daily lives of Manistee residents as much as possible. To create this dichotomy within the City Historic Downtown Manistee and 1st Street Beach should be the all-encompassing destination within the city of Manistee itself, with direct shuttles to nearby destinations such as the casino, ski slopes, nature trails, etc.. 

From River Street from Maple Street to Division Street would be treated as an "outdoor mall", though that description does not do it justice. These historic buildings would become a unique shopping, dining, and spa experience filled with botique shops in a well-preserved historic setting, but still be able to offer many modern amenities. There should absolutely be a draw for Chicagoans to "hop the boat for a weekend of shopping" away from the crowded city. 

River street, from Maple to Division at the least, will be repaved with brick and heated to keep the street clear and dry year-round without the destructive effect of snowplows. The trollies running non-stop throughout the day back and forth down River Street from Manistee Lake to 1st Street Beach will make stops in this area and all along River Street. 

Buildings and properties on this stretch that are not historically protected and do not fit with the Victorian image of the City will be gradually replaced with new buildings that do fit with the setting. These new buildings will outwardly appear to be individual Victorian buildings, but their new construction could allow for spaces and functions not possible in the standing historic buildings. 

Aboslutely no neon signs. Keep things classy and classic. 

**Open mall**

All buildings From Maple to Division street will have their sidewalks glassed in on each side for each block. This makes going from store to store easier for patrons year round. It should also offer the historic facades a level of elemental protection and possibly offer additional insulation for these buildings. 

These glassed walkways should be as unabstrusive as possible visually, encompasing the height of the first floor. A slight pitch and light heating during the winter months should keep the snow sliding onto the street, which in turn is heated and drained to keep all walkways clear with minimal effort.

A multi-rail railing on the interior of exterior glass wall, something that keeps with the motif but are durable (think wrought iron) will help to keep accidental glass damage to a minimum.

The top half of the wall should slide out and down, half-opening the wall when weather permits.

Entry doors should be placed at the ends of each block. Most pedestrian crossings of River, Poplar, and Greenbush can happen at these corners as they do today, but with much less motorist traffic.

Additional doors can be placed along the length of the encolsures as deemed useful for foot traffic. 

With only the trollies and emergency vechicles traveling along these blocks there will be a lot of open space on River Street. It should be utilized for parades (see events) and possibly outdoor vendors with appropriate weather. 

**Second story**

Perhaps the hardest change to champion is the upper floor of these historic buildings. Most residential and office now, these should be converted for more commercial shops. 

The difficulty with this, from both a convenience and accessability perspective, is each building's second floor is accessible almost solely by an individual staircase. 

While historical societies generally shy away from making any modifications to building layouts, the one-time change will be important to maintaining these buildings as a whole for years to come. 

With possible exceptions such as the Vogue Theater or Ramsdell Inn, each upper floor shall have the first ten feet at the front of the building converted into one long block-stretching hallway. Some existing stairwells will become publicly-accessible staircases that will connect back to this hallway. At least one per block should be converted to a public elevator to provide for handicap accesibility, and one to a private freight elevator for shops to bring in deliveries. 

The inner wall of this hallway could then be either a glass wall to match the outdoor portion of the lower level, or newly created storefront facades in the Victorian style to match their downstairs counterparts. One-time changes to interior layouts should be made only where necessary to allow these spaces to be viable commercial stores. Retailers would then need to work their stores into this setup so as to prevent further changes. 

**Bridging the gap**

There may also be opportunity to create pedestrian bridges across Poplar, and/or Greenbush so that patrons do not need to go down and back up to get to another portion of the "mall". These would need to strictly match the existing architecture. While a bridge across River Street would be enticing, it would have to be weighed against the preclusion of getting the traditional Christmas Tree Sleigh down River Street, unless some sort of draw-bridge situation could be worked out. 

**Parking entraces**

Substantial parking space behind the buildings on the south side of River Street will allow easy access for both local residents and those that drove in for their vacation. 

An entrace along each block on the second floor, most likely aligned with public stairwells inside, will provide upper-street-level access. Patrons can still utilize the sidewalks along Poplar and Greenbush - the main advantage to the second-floor entrace will be for patrons who may have difficulty coming up and down the hills.
